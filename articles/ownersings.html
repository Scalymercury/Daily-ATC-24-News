      <h2>Beloved ATC24 Server Owner Sings “O Canada” and Hosts Pseudo QnA</h2>
      
      <p><strong>ATC24 Newsroom, June 30, 2025</strong> A lovely moment that has the entire ATC24 family smiling, Treelon, a dedicated Canadian server manager loved by all in the community, gave an unforgettable and exclusive performance of “O Canada” recently.</p>
      <p>Known for keeping the servers fun and always cracking jokes, he surprised the community by singing the anthem live in Training Center voice chat. Those listening called the performance powerful and real—a perfect mix of his warmth and the community spirit we all share.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, along with this wonderful performance, Treelon hosted a QnA in Training Room voice chat, aimed to strengthen staff-member relationships. Some key takeaways from the QnA:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Treelon works in the event industry</li>
        <li>Treelon is 19</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With Canada Day tomorrow, Treelon’s performance has turned into an early party for Canadian members and a shared moment of unity for everyone at ATC24—a sweet reminder that online friends can cross any border.</p>
