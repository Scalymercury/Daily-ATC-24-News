      <h2>📣 ATC24 Bot to be updated soon</h2>
      <p>Yesterday, July 2nd, 2025, Server Manager and developer AutumnHTDG confirmed in a suggestion that an update to the ATC24 bot may come soon.</p>
      <p>This update is set to involve the online-atc list, and is set to roll out in the next version of the ATC24 bot. For now, the only confirmed change is that all callsigns with "Tower" in the list will be changed to "Center" as decided by the community. As of now, we can only speculate what else this update to the bot will bring.</p>
