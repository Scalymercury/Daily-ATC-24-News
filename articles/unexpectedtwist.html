      <p><strong>📣 The enroute callsign vote just flipped — “Center” has now overtaken “Control” for the first time since the poll opened!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>📊 New Standings (as of July 1, 2025 12:43 PM):</strong><br>
      ❌ Control: 48% (434 votes)<br>
      ✅ Center: 52% (462 votes)</p>
      <p>🗽 With 896 total votes and 10 hours left, it’s clear that the US daytime surge is pushing “Center” ahead — just as predicted in the last update! 📈</p>
      <p>🌎 This shift shows just how split the ATC24 community is on what the official enroute callsign should be.</p>
      <p><strong>⚡ Key Takeaway:</strong><br>
      “Center” has added 206 votes since the last check, while “Control” gained only 164 — a net swing of +42 for “Center”!<br>
      At this pace, “Control” will need a big push to catch up.</p>
      <p>🕙 Time left: 10 hours — your vote still counts and could change the result!<br>
      🚦 The final outcome will be final and non-negotiable, deciding the only valid enroute callsign for all stations.</p>
      <p>🗳️ Have you voted yet? Get in before it closes! ✈️</p>
